Release checklist
-----------------

Pick a new $version. The versioning scheme we use is:
  0.2.7 < (0.3.0_rc1_pre) < 0.3.0_rc1 < (0.3.0_rc2_pre) < 0.3.0_rc2 < 0.3.0 << 0.3.1 <<< 0.4.0

Note:
 * "rc" stands for Release Candidate
 * the "_pre" versions are used just as a placeholder between RCs
 * if you are about to bump the first or second number in the $version, it
   means you need to start a new maintenance branch, for instance:

     git checkout -b 0.4.x master

   otherwise (you're bumping just the last digit, or rc number), check out the
   existing maintenance branch:

     git checkout 0.4.x

   Note: the "x" is literal in this branch name.

# Prepare and tag the source:
version=....
make check
make -C po update-po
git commit -m 'Refreshed the PO files.' po/
vi configure.ac # bump the version to $version
git commit -m "Bumped the version to $version." configure.ac
git tag ekg2_$version
git push
git push origin ekg2_$version

# Update the website:
cd ../ekg2-website
vi -O index.php en/index.php # mention $version
git commit -m "Mentioned $version." index.php en/index.php
git push

# Publish:
ssh toxygen.net
$HOME/ekg2-website/website-scripts/release ekg_$version
crontab -l # find and use the command line to push website update

Other notes:
- After doing an "rc1", drop "rc*" tags from the _previous_ release.
