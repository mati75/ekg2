   - experimental GTK+ interface [ekg2-ui-gtk]
   - experimental HTTP interface
   - experimental 'remote' interface [ekg2-remote]
   - spell checking [ekg2-ui-ncurses]
   - "remote control" via pipe or socket
   - XOSD support [ekg2-xosd]
   - jogger.pl blog update support
   - a simple CAPTCHA (autoresponder)
   - Python and Perl scripting [ekg2-scripting-python, ekg2-scripting-perl]
   - launching shell commands on certain events
   - encryption support (SIM, GnuPG, ROT13) [ekg2-core, ekg2-gnupg]
   - logging to SQLite, plain text or XML files
   - sending SMs (using an external program such as sms-pl)
   - mail checking
