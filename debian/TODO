Things to do before releasing any new version of the package:

 - check that plugins/*, plugins/README, configure.ac AC_CONFIG_FILES,PLUGINS,
   debian/control and /usr/lib/ekg2/plugins are in sync

 - after the last point, below, is completed, audit the diff between previous
   and pending release, and propagate to debian/copyright:
   * copyright year changes
   * new/changed copyright holders
   * new files without copyright/license
   * code copied from other projects with slightly differing license

Add freedesktop org files

Check exactly which features work, and improve description and README.Debian.

In case ioctl plugin is revived, make sure the package still builds on non-linux ports.

Perhaps some autotools improvements?:
 - config.status: WARNING:  po/Makefile.in.in seems to ignore the --datarootdir setting

Investigate warning: #warning "PATH_MAX not found! Defaulting to 4096, please report."

Resolve stylesheet location with upstream.

Is current mailbox support OK with the policy?

Correct copyright information - see http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2008/10/msg00017.html
 - it needs to be formatted properly (perhaps according to
   http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat)
 - furthermore, there are many problematic cases:
   * in some files, copyright holder is missing
   * in some files, license is missing
   * in some files (effectively all those not listed below) both copyright and
     license are missing - need to decide what to do about them. One way is
     asking upstream to provide this information at least for the largest (i.e.
     most important) files.
     Then for the smaller files just add a line saying that the license is the
     same as for the whole package (specified in the README), but this does not
     solve the issue of providing a copyright owner.
     Also, for many tiny files (small xml snippets and tiny makefiles), perhaps
     nobody cares enough to specify a license and copyright holder? Maybe we
     should seek advice on debian-legal?
   * also in some cases, code is taken from other projects, with possibly
     slightly differing license (such as the "or any later version" clause).
     These should be audited.
 - might be good to update FSF's address
